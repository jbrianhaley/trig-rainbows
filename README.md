# trig-rainbows
A simple website to create and customize colors and corresponding rgb values.<br>
I found myself using the same code over and over to generate random colors in python, but I wanted an easier way to play with the values directly and see what happens.  The website allows the user to change values and lists rgb values to cut and paste for use elsewhere.
